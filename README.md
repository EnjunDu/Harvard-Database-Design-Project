# Harvard-Database-Design-Project
This project is a practical assessment that applies your knowledge of database concepts to a real-world dataset. You are required to understand a publicly available dataset, design a conceptual model for storing the data, normalize the model, build the database, import the data, and develop SQL queries based on specific requirements.
