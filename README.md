# Harvard-Database-Design-Project
This project is a practical assessment that applies your knowledge of database concepts to a real-world dataset. You are required to understand a publicly available dataset, design a conceptual model for storing the data, normalize the model, build the database, import the data, and develop SQL queries based on specific requirements.
Project Title and Requirements Summary
Title:
Database Design Project

Overview:
This project is a practical assessment that applies your knowledge of database concepts to a real-world dataset. You are required to understand a publicly available dataset, design a conceptual model for storing the data, normalize the model, build the database, import the data, and develop SQL queries based on specific requirements.

Part A: Understanding the Data (0 Marks, Preliminary Work)

Analyze the given public dataset: "A Global Database of COVID-19 Vaccinations." Review and understand the structure and content of the provided CSV files.
Part B: Designing the Database (10%)

Task B.1: Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a relational database to store the dataset. The ER diagram should be created using Lucidchart and must follow good database design principles.
Document your normalization process, detailing any challenges and changes made to ensure the schema is in at least 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
Provide a database schema based on the ER diagram and normalization process.
Part C: Creating the Database and Importing Data (10%)

Task C.1: Produce an SQL script file (Database.sql) containing SQL statements to create all database tables and constraints according to your design.
Task C.2: Create a database file (Vaccinations.db) using SQLite Studio and import the data from the given CSV files into your database. Ensure the data structure matches your database schema.
Part D: Data Retrieval and Visualization (15%)

Tasks D.1-D.5: Develop five SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database. Each query must be documented in a script file (Queries.sql).
For each query, produce a PDF file (Queries.pdf) that includes:
The SQL query.
A screenshot of the first 10 results, including the total number of results.
A data visualization representing the query results (e.g., charts or graphs).
Submission Format:
Submit the following files:

Model.pdf: Contains the ER diagram, normalization explanation, and database schema.
Database.sql: Contains SQL statements to create the database.
Vaccinations.db: The SQLite database file with imported data.
Queries.sql: Contains all SQL queries.
Queries.pdf: Contains SQL queries, screenshots of results, and visualizations.
Assessment Criteria:
Your submission will be evaluated based on your ability to:

Analyze and understand the dataset.
Develop a conceptual database model.
Use ER modeling tools and apply normalization.
Create and populate the database.
Write effective SQL queries.
Represent data visually in a meaningful way.
By following these requirements, you will demonstrate your proficiency in database design and implementation, and your ability to handle and analyze real-world data.
